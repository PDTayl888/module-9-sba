How you implemented React and TypeScript features
    I used functional components with prop interfaces and type enums.

The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them
    It took me forever to get the filtering to work for every status and priority. Composing the functions to filter from search terms was a ridiculous amount of trial and error.

Your approach to component composition and state management
    Ato first I was doing the input for the search term in the dashboard but then I decided all aspects of filtering should be done in one component.
    The dashboard renders everything and the app  renders the dashboard. I decided to go with a general nature farming theme for the app instead of standard statuses and priorities
    and labels in general. The app follows the exact specs pattern specified in the instruction just with different names for the statuses and priorities and title and description.
    Functionally it is exactly as specified although with different names for the different specs.
